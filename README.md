# 🧬 Genomic Population Study 🔬

A genomics population health study on diabetes, hypertension, and weight.

## 📁 File Guide

- **TraitDataAnalysis**: Used to analyze each trait and assessment based on population segments
- **TraitDataAnalysisV2**: Contains additional graphing methods
- **graphGenerator**: Create graphs for all trait assessments
- **dataProcessing**: Used for initial data preprocessing and experimenting with ways to group the information
- **demographicDataAnalysis**: Used to generate statistics on demographics of patients in the study
- **final_df**: Groups all traits and assessments with segmentation data in a single CSV file
- **final_df_coded**: Groups all traits and assessments with segmentation data in a single CSV file, but results are changed from text to variables and codes for easier analysis in pandas

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.8+ and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn

```

## 📊 Data Visualization

This project uses various data visualization techniques to analyze the genomic data. Some of the key visualizations include:

- Bar charts
- Stacked bar charts
- Pie charts
- Heatmaps

## 🔍 Key Features

- Analysis of genetic traits related to diabetes, hypertension, and weight
- Demographic data analysis
- BMI classification and analysis
- Correlation studies between genetic traits and health conditions

## 📈 Usage

1. Start with the `dataProcessing.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the data.
2. Use `demographicDataAnalysis.ipynb` to analyze patient demographics.
3. Run `TraitDataAnalysis.ipynb` and `TraitDataAnalysisV2.ipynb` for in-depth trait analysis.
4. Generate visualizations using `graphGenerator.ipynb`.
